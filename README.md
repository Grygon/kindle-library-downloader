## Prerequisites

- Currently this only works on www.amazon.com, not any regional domains.
- You must have at least one Kindle device linked to your account (this device is not used in the process of this script, but Amazon won't let you download anything if you don't have a device).

## How to Use

- Install GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey in your browser if you don't have it already
- Click here to install the script: TBD
- Log in to your Amazon account
- Navigate to the "All Books" page of the "Digital Content" section of your Amazon account. [This link](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/contentlist/booksAll/dateDsc) might take you there, but you may need to find the page on your own:
- Make sure you're on the first page of results
- Click "Download All" near the top of the page
- Wait for it to finish. It takes ~10 seconds per book, so it can take a while. It should show a pop-up when it's done.

## How do I stop it once it's started?

Refresh the page and it'll stop running.

## Something Break?

### I got an Amazon Dogs page

If you see one of the Amazon Error pages (with the dogs), something broke and you'll (sadly) have to start over. The script starts on whatever page of results you have selected and continues from there; if you successfully downloaded the first page before it failed, restart on the second, etc.
